Final Project - Concordia Bootcamps, August 2022
React.js, Node.js, Express, MongoDb Atlas
API: mockoon 


*Description*
Because of my career history working as a fundraiser in the non-profit sector and my recent graduation from Concordia Bootcamp, I have been contracted by a non-profit arts organization, ArtConnect, here in Montreal that raises money to send kids who otherwise couldn’t afford it to art school (don’t worry, they’ve received a grant to pay me!) As part of their new fundraising goals, ArtConnect wants to have a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) created for them. Big CRMS like Hubspot or DonorPerfect are designed for larger organizations and ArtConnect wants a CRM that meets their specific and more humble needs as an organization. 

Main Features:
-A section to track information about donors, fundraisers and grants 
-The ability to view historical data of all past donors, past fundraisers and past grants
-The ability to edit all historical data, including updating information
-The ability to create new donor profiles, new fundraiser accounts and new grant files for current and future data
-The ability to delete historical data that is no longer relevant

-Every page can be downloaded as a PDF to serve as donor, fundraiser or grant reports for the organization to use
-A search bar to quickly parse through all of the data housed on in the cloud for easy navigation
